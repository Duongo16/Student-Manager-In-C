# Student-Manager-In-C

The Student Management System (SMS) is a console-based application developed in C to efficiently handle student records. With a user-friendly menu interface, it offers essential features like adding and deleting students, displaying the student list, and saving to or reading from a file. Users can input details for multiple students, remove specific students by providing their ID, and view the complete student list in a tabular format. Additionally, the system supports file operations, allowing users to save student information to a specified ".txt" file and read data from an existing ".txt" file. The compilation process involves using the gcc compiler, and the program can be executed to perform these operations seamlessly. The project follows the MIT License, providing flexibility for modification and use as required.
